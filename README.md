# RevengeLearn: A Digital Storefront

This project is a direct-to-consumer digital storefront for selling and delivering course content. The core principle is simplicity. We use a "Purchase & Access Link" model to eliminate the need for user accounts and complex authentication systems.

## How It Works

1.  Users purchase courses through a third-party payment provider.
2.  Upon successful payment, they receive a unique, permanent link to access the course content.
3.  Course content is hosted on YouTube (unlisted) and embedded within our clean, focused interface.

## Tech Stack

*   Next.js & React
*   Tailwind CSS
*   Vercel KV (for a simple key-value store)
*   Next.js API Routes (for serverless functions)
